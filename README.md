Hungry Backspace for Sublime Text
------------------------------------

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/package-control-blue.svg?style=plastic)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Hungry%20Backspace)

### Overview

This small plugin brings to Sublime Text the "hungry backspace" feature from IntelliJ. The hungry backspace retains the scope (indentation) when the backspace key is pressed on an empty line.

### Live demo

### Warning

This plugin is **NOT** meant to replace backspace entirely, it is meant to be used in conjunction with the original backspace function which is now accessed by **Shift+Backspace**

#### (!) USE THE DEFAULT BACKSPACE WHENEVER YOU NEED IT USING SHIFT+BACKSPACE



### Version

1.1.4

### What's new

##### New features demo

![](http://i.imgur.com/5cNpCV3.gif)

  Added 3 new features based on IntelliJ's smart backspace, of which two are experimental and one is enabled by default.

  *  [Experimental] When you press backspace with your cursor at line start
     if the indentation level of the current line is wrong it is reindented
     Options: "enabled"/ "disabled" / "forced"

     `"right_to_left_backspacing" : true`

  *  If you are on line start and the upper line is empty
     the current line gets moved one up

     `"consume_above_line": true`

  *  [Experimental] If you are on line start and press backspace and the upper line is not empty
     the current lines contents get moved up
     Options: "enabled"/ "disabled" / "forced"

     "backspace_line_content_move": "enabled"





## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`HungryBackspace`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

### Key bindings
By default this plugin overrides your backspace with the "hungry" one however, as mentioned previously the plugin is meant to be used in conjunction with the default backspace which is now accessible via `SHIFT+BACKSPACE`. You can flip between space and shift-backspace at any time by pressing **CTRL+.(dot)**

```
[
  // the hungry backspace
  { "keys": ["backspace"], "command": "hungry_backspace" },
  // the default backspace
  { "keys": ["shift+backspace"], "command": "default_backspace"},
  // flipping the hungry and default backspace actions
  { "keys": ["ctrl+."], "command": "flip_hungry_backspace_key_bindings"}
]
```

### Settings
```
{
  // enable/disable plugin
  "enabled": true,
  // filetypes with these extensions don't have hungry backspacing
  "excluded_filetypes": ["hs", "py"],
  // controls whether the default/hungry backspace bindings should be flipped
  "flipped_key_bindings": false,
  // when the upper line is empty but contains some indentation a backspace
  // causes the upper line to obtain this lines indentation
  "force_indent_at_upper_level" : true,
  // [Experimental] When you press backspace with your cursor at line start
  // if the indentation level of the current line is wrong it is reindented
  // Options: "enabled"/ "disabled" / "forced"
  "right_to_left_backspacing" : "disabled",
  // If you are on line start and the upper line is empty
  // the current line gets moved one up
  "consume_above_line": true,
  // [Experimental] If you are on line start and press backspace and the upper line is not empty
  // the current lines contents get moved up
  // Options: "enabled"/ "disabled" / "forced"
  "backspace_line_content_move": "disabled"
}
```
