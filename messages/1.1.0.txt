[New features!]

  Added 3 new features based on IntelliJ's smart backspace, of which two are experimental and one is enabled by default. Feel free to try them out

  *  [Experimental] When you press backspace with your cursor at line start
     if the indentation level of the current line is wrong it is reindented

     "right_to_left_backspacing" : true

  *  If you are on line start and the upper line is empty
     the current line gets moved one up

     "consume_above_line": true

  *  [Experimental] If you are on line start and press backspace and the upper line is not empty
     the current lines contents get moved up

     "backspace_line_content_move": true
